Not all coffee is brewed in the same way. Different brewing styles can result in changes in the flavor and strength of the drink. Here are just a few brewing styles that you may choose to incorporate in your shop:

Drip Brew. Ground coffee is added to a brew basket and placed in an automatic coffee machine for this brewing style. Gravity is used to pass water through the grounds, resulting in a traditional cup of coffee.
Pour Over. This brewing style is achieved by pouring boiling water slowly through coffee grounds as they sit in a filter basket. The coffee then drips into a single cup, resulting in a strong brew.
Cold Brew. For this method, coarsely ground coffee is placed in room temperature water and allowed to steep for an extended period of time. This results in a less bitter brew while still remaining high in caffeine.
Espresso. To achieve an espresso brew, pressurized hot water is passed through a filter containing finely ground dark roasted beans using a cappuccino or espresso machine. The force of the water produces a highly concentrated coffee shot. This is the method most commonly used for the base of coffee drinks.
Ristretto. Brewed in a similar method to the espresso, pressurized water is passed through the coffee grounds. However, you would use half the amount of water. The shorter brewing cycle creates a more concentrated and darker shot of espresso.
Different Coffee Drinks
Most coffee drinks consist of three common ingredients: espresso, steamed milk, and foam. Additional toppings can be added based on your customers’ unique preferences. The following are just some of the coffee drinks and possible cup pairings you may consider adding to your menu. It’s important to note that drink ratios may vary from coffee shop to coffee shop.

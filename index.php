        <h3>Arabica</h3>
        <p>
        Starting with a fan favorite among coffee connoisseurs,
         estimates for Arabica’s prevalence in the world production range
          from 60 to 75 percent. These plants are occasionally referred to as
           the mountain varieties because they are grown at higher altitudes with ample shade and steady rainfall.

        <h3>Robusta</h3>
        <p>Next, the other very common type of coffee bean is Robusta.
         Rather than gaining its popularity through quality and depth of the brew,
          these plants are popular for for their high caffeine level and hardiness. 
        While they do thrive in hotter climates and varied rainfall, Robusta beans
         are known for being able to put up with a much wider range of climates and altitudes. Also,
         they withstand diseases much better than other varieties. That resistance makes them better for growing in large crops. </p>

         <h3>Liberica and Excelsa</h3>
         <p>Excelsa is actually a sub variety of Liberica; however, the two types have very different profiles, so many people still consider them two completely different types. 

         Liberica beans peaked in popularity in the 1890s when coffee rust destroyed 90% of the world’s Arabica crops. The Philippines were the first to start any kind of serious production and thus became a major supplier. 
         
         These beans were (and are when you can find them
          known for having a distinct, woody or smoky flavor with a full body and floral or fruity aroma.
